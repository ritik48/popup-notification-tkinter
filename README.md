# Popup Notification In Tkinter

I have created a Notification class which extends from tk.Frame . It's helpful when a user wants to show a popup notification when certain event occurs, like when a user gets logged in, or can also be used to indicate certain warnings.

The Notification class require followings as the argument:
 * frame width
 * frame height
 * notification text
 * frames background colo
 * font for the text
 * notification icon
 * close button's image
 * notifications y-coordinate
